Explanation:
* The SGA_TARGET parameter can be dynamically increased up to the value specified for the SGA_MAX_SIZE parameter, and it can also be reduced.
* Example:
For example, suppose you have an environment with the following configuration:
SGA_MAX_SIZE = 1024M
SGA_TARGET = 512M
DB_8K_CACHE_SIZE = 128M
In this example, the value of SGA_TARGET can be resized up to 1024M and can also be reduced until one or more of the automatically sized components reaches its minimum size. The exact value depends on environmental factors such as the number of CPUs on the system. However, the value of DB_8K_CACHE_SIZE remains fixed at all times at 128M
* DB_8K_CACHE_SIZE
Size of cache for 8K buffers

On your Oracle Database, you issue the following commands to create indexes:
SQL > CREATE INDEX oe.ord_customer_ix1 ON oe.orders (customer_id, sales_rep_id) INVISIBLE;
SQL> CREATE BITMAP INDEX oe.ord_customer_ix2 ON oe.orders (customer_id, sales_rep_id);
Which two statements are true?
A.
Only the ORD_CUSTOMER_IX1 index created.
B.
Both the indexes are updated when a row is inserted, updated, or deleted in the ORDERS table.
C.
Both the indexes are created: however, only ORD_CUSTOMERS_IX1 is used by the optimizer for queries on the ORDERS table.
D.
The ORD_CUSTOMER_IX1 index is not used by the optimizer even when the OPTIMIZER_USE_INVISIBLE_INDEXES parameters is set to true.
E.
Both the indexes are created and used by the optimizer for queries on the ORDERS table.
F.
Both the indexes are created: however, only ORD_CUSTOMERS_IX2 is used by the optimizer for queries on the ORDERS table.

Explanation:
Not A: Both indexes are created fine.
B: The invisible index ORD_CUSTOMERS_IX1 and the bitmap index are both updated by DML
operations on the Orders table.
F: Since ORD_CUSTOMERS_IX1 is invisible only ORD_CUSTOMERS_IX2 is used by the query
optimizer.
Not C,Not D,Not E:
* ord_customer_ix1 is an invisible index and is therefore not used by the optimizer.
* VISIBLE | INVISIBLE Use this clause to specify whether the index is visible or invisible to the
optimizer. An invisible index is maintained by DML operations, but it is not be used by the
optimizer during queries unless you explicitly set the parameter
OPTIMIZER_USE_INVISIBLE_INDEXES to TRUE at the session or system level.
Note: Specify BITMAP to indicate that index is to be created with a bitmap for each distinct key,
rather than indexing each row separately. Bitmap indexes store the rowids associated with a key
value as a bitmap. Each bit in the bitmap corresponds to a possible rowid. If the bit is set, then it
means that the row with the corresponding rowid contains the key value. The internal
representation of bitmaps is best suited for applications with low levels of concurrent transactions,
such as data warehousing.

A warehouse fact table in your Oracle 12c Database is range-partitioned by month and accessed frequently with queries that span multiple partitions The table has a local prefixed, range partitioned index.
Some of these queries access very few rows in some partitions and all the rows in other partitions, but these queries still perform a full scan for all accessed partitions.
This commonly occurs when the range of dates begins at the end of a month or ends close to the start of a month.
You want an execution plan to be generated that uses indexed access when only a few rows are accessed from a segment, while still allowing full scans for segments where many rows are returned.
Which three methods could transparently help to achieve this result?
A.
Using a partial local Index on the warehouse fact table month column with indexing disabled to the table partitions that return most of their rows to the queries.
B.
Using a partial local Index on the warehouse fact table month column with indexing disabled for the table partitions that return a few rows to the queries.
C.
Using a partitioned view that does a UNION ALL query on the partitions of the warehouse fact table, which retains the existing local partitioned column.
D.
Converting the partitioned table to a partitioned view that does a UNION ALL query on the monthly tables, which retains the existing local partitioned column.
E.
Using a partial global index on the warehouse fact table month column with indexing disabling for the table partitions that return most of their rows to the queries.
F.
Using a partial global index on the warehouse fact table month column with indexing disabled for the table partitions that return a few rows to the queries.

Which three statements are true about Flashback Database?
A.
Flashback logs are written sequentially, and are archived.
B.
Flashback Database uses a restored control file to recover a database.
C.
The Oracle database automatically creates, deletes, and resides flashback logs in the Fast Recovery Area.
D.
Flashback Database can recover a database to the state that it was in before a reset logs operation.
E.
Flashback Database can recover a data file that was dropped during the span of time of the flashback.
F.
Flashback logs are used to restore to the blocks’ before images, and then the redo data may be used to roll forward to the desired flashback time.

Explanation:
* Flashback Database uses its own logging mechanism, creating flashback logs and
storing them in the fast recovery area (C). You can only use Flashback Database if flashback logs
are available. To take advantage of this feature, you must set up your database in advance to
create flashback logs.
* To enable Flashback Database, you configure a fast recovery area and set a flashback retention
target. This retention target specifies how far back you can rewind a database with Flashback
Database.
From that time onwards, at regular intervals, the database copies images of each altered block in
every data file into the flashback logs. These block images can later be reused to reconstruct the
data file contents for any moment at which logs were captured. (F)
Incorrect:
Not E: You cannot use Flashback Database alone to retrieve a dropped data file. If you flash back
a database to a time when a dropped data file existed in the database, only the data file entry is
added to the control file. You can only recover the dropped data file by using RMAN to fully restore
and recover the data file.
Oracle Database Backup and Recovery User’s Guide 12c R

F) ->
http://docs.oracle.com/database/121/BRADV/flashdb.htm#BRADV582
From that time onwards, at regular intervals, the database copies images of each altered block in every data file into the flashback logs. These block images can later be reused to reconstruct the data file contents for any moment at which logs were captured.
When you use Flashback Database to rewind a database to a past target time, the command determines which blocks changed after the target time and restores them from the flashback logs. The database restores the version of each block that is immediately before the target time. The database then uses redo logs to reapply changes that were made after these blocks were written to the flashback logs.
Redo logs on disk or tape must be available for the entire time period spanned by the flashback logs. For example, if the flashback retention target is 1 week, then you must ensure that online and archived redo logs that contain all changes for the past week are accessible. In practice, redo logs are typically needed much longer than the flashback retention target to support point-in-time recovery.
D) ->
You can use Flashback Database to reverse most unwanted changes to a database if the data files are intact. You can return a database to its state in a previous incarnation, and undo the effects of an ALTER DATABASE OPEN RESETLOGS statement

Flashback Database
Flashback Database is similar to conventional point-in-time recovery in its effects. It enables you to return a database to its state at a time in the recent past. Flashback Database is much faster than point-in-time recovery because it does not require restoring data files from backup and requires applying fewer changes from the archived redo logs.
You can use Flashback Database to reverse most unwanted changes to a database if the data files are intact. You can return a database to its state in a previous incarnation, and undo the effects of an ALTER DATABASE OPEN RESETLOGS statement. “Rewinding a Database with Flashback Database” explains how to use the FLASHBACK DATABASE command to reverse database changes.

Which statement is true about Enterprise Manager (EM) express in Oracle Database 12c?
A.
By default, EM express is available for a database after database creation.
B.
You can use EM express to manage multiple databases running on the same server.
C.
You can perform basic administrative tasks for pluggable databases by using the EM express interface.
D.
You cannot start up or shut down a database Instance by using EM express.
E.
You can create and configure pluggable databases by using EM express.

Explanation:
EM Express is built inside the database.
Note:
Oracle Enterprise Manager Database Express (EM Express) is a web-based database
management tool that is built inside the Oracle Database. It supports key performance
management and basic database administration functions. From an architectural perspective, EM
Express has no mid-tier or middleware components, ensuring that its overhead on the database
server is negligible.
D is correct.
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/manageability/emx-intro-1965965.html
Why E is not correct?http://docs.oracle.com/database/121/ADMQS/pdbs.htm#ADMQS12512
Would also vote for D.
Sorry … “E” I meant.
D
Lol seriously oracle?! D and E are both correct!
It is not possible to start/stop the DB instance with EM Express….
At bottom A could be also correct, because if you install Oracle 12c the EM Express will be installed too
The question should be which one is not true……
A C D E
This is confusing – all answers are correct …
… including B(!)
It is possible, to manage different databases on the same machine.
All you have to do is configuring individual ports:
“You can use EM Express to manage a non-CDB, a CDB, or a PDB. For each non-CDB, CDB, or PDB that you want to manage using EM Express on a given host, a unique HTTPS port must be configured. A different port must be configured for each container in a CDB that you want to manage using EM Express.”

Examine the following command;
ALTER SYSTEM SET enable_ddl_logging = TRUE;
Which statement is true?
A.
Only the data definition language (DDL) commands that resulted in errors are logged in the alert log file.
B.
All DDL commands are logged in the alert log file.
C.
All DDL commands are logged in a different log file that contains DDL statements and their execution dates.
D.
Only DDL commands that resulted in the creation of new segments are logged.
E.
All DDL commands are logged in XML format in the alert directory under the Automatic Diagnostic Repository (ADR) home.

Explanation:
Once DDL logging is turned on, every DDL command will be logged in the alert log
file and also the log.xml file.
Note:
* By default Oracle database does not log any DDL operations performed by any user. The default
settings for auditing only logs DML operations.
* Oracle 12c DDL Logging – ENABLE_DDL_LOGGING
The first method is by using the enabling a DDL logging feature built into the database. By default
it is turned off and you can turn it on by setting the value of ENABLE_DDL_LOGGING initialization
parameter to true.
* We can turn it on using the following command. The parameter is dynamic and you can turn it
on/off on the go.
SQL> alter system set ENABLE_DDL_LOGGING=true;
System altered.
Elapsed: 00:00:00.05
SQL>
Once it is turned on, every DDL command will be logged in the alert log file and also the log.xml
file.
The DDL log is a file that has the same format and basic behavior as the alert log, but it only contains the DDL statements issued by the database. There are two DDL logs that contain the same information. One is an XML file, and the other is a text file. The DDL log is stored in the log/ddl subdirectory of the ADR home.
http://docs.oracle.com/database/121/REFRN/refrn10302.htm#REFRN10302
i think that E is correct
c
E
https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/REFRN/refrn10302.htm#REFRN10302
I think E is not correct, cause there are two files generated when ENABLE_DDL_LOGGING is set to TRUE. One is a text file (with only the DDL commands but no dates) is located in ADR_HOME/log, another is the XML format file (with DDL commands and execution timestamp) which is located in ADR_HOME/log/ddl. But E indicates ALERT directory, which is not correct.
Answer C actually means the XML format DDL log file in ADR_HOME/log/ddl/
https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/REFRN/GUID-6FBA6147-D545-4E7D-94F0-A97EC1C721AE.htm
ENABLE_DDL_LOGGING enables or disables the writing of a subset of data definition language (DDL) statements to a DDL log.
The DDL log is a file that has the same format and basic behavior as the alert log, but it only contains the DDL statements issued by the database. The DDL log is created only for the RDBMS component and only if the ENABLE_DDL_LOGGING initialization parameter is set to true. When this parameter is set to false, DDL statements are not included in any log.
The DDL log contains one log record for each DDL statement issued by the database. The DDL log is included in IPS incident packages.
There are two DDL logs that contain the same information. One is an XML file, and the other is a text file. The DDL log is stored in the log/ddl subdirectory of the ADR home.

In which two scenarios do you use SQL* Loader to load data?
A.
Transform the data while it is being loaded into the database.
B.
Use transparent parallel processing without having to split the external data first.
C.
Load data into multiple tables during the same load statement.
D.
Generate unique sequential key values in specified columns.

Explanation:
You can use SQL*Loader to do the following:
/ (A) Manipulate the data before loading it, using SQL functions.
/ (D) Generate unique sequential key values in specified columns.
etc:
/ Load data into multiple tables during the same load session.
/ Load data across a network. This means that you can run the SQL*Loader client on a different
system from the one that is running the SQL*Loader server.
/ Load data from multiple datafiles during the same load session.
/Specify the character set of the data.
/ Selectively load data (you can load records based on the records’ values).
/Use the operating system’s file system to access the datafiles.
/ Load data from disk, tape, or named pipe.
/ Generate sophisticated error reports, which greatly aid troubleshooting.
/ Load arbitrarily complex object-relational data.
/ Use secondary datafiles for loading LOBs and collections.
/ Use either conventional or direct path loading. While conventional path loading is very flexible,
direct path loading provides superior loading performance.
Note:
* SQL*Loader loads data from external files into tables of an Oracle database. It has a powerful
data parsing engine that puts little limitation on the format of the data in the datafile.
CD
http://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14215/ldr_concepts.htm

Enable supplemental logging is prerequisites for flashback transaction query feature. So it may not necessary for performing a flashback transaction? I’m not very sure
C, D
Following prerequisites must be met to perform a Flashback Transaction on an Oracle Database 12c database:
– The database must be in ARCHIVELOG mode
– Supplemental logging must be enabled in the database using ALTER DATABASE ADD SUPPLEMENTAL LOG DATA
– A supplemental log data primary key should be created using the statement ALTER DATABASE ADD SUPPLEMENTAL LOG DATA (PRIMARY KEY) COLUMNS
– The user performing the Flashback Transaction must have the SELECT ANY TRANSACTION privilege
– The user should have the EXECUTE privilege on DBMS_FLASHBACK
– The user should also have appropriate DML privileges on the tables (such as INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE)
So the correct answer should be C and D.

A database is stored in an Automatic Storage Management (ASM) disk group, disk group, DGROUP1 with SQL:
There is enough free space in the disk group for mirroring to be done.
What happens if the CONTROLLER1 failure group becomes unavailable due to error of for maintenance?
A.
Transactions and queries accessing database objects contained in any tablespace stored in DGROUP1 will fall.
B.
Mirroring of allocation units will be done to ASM disks in the CONTROLLER2 failure group until the CONTROLLER1 for failure group is brought back online.
C.
The data in the CONTROLLER1 failure group is copied to the controller2 failure group and rebalancing is initiated.
D.
ASM does not mirror any data until the controller failure group is brought back online, and newly allocated primary allocation units (AU) are stored in the controller2 failure group, without mirroring.
E.
Transactions accessing database objects contained in any tablespace stored in DGROUP1 will fail but queries will succeed.

On your Oracle 12c database, you Issue the following commands to create indexes
SQL > CREATE INDEX oe.ord_customer_ix1 ON oe.orders (customers_id, sales_rep_id) INVISIBLE;
SQL> CREATE BITMAP INDEX oe.ord_customer_ix2 ON oe.orders (customers_id, sales_rep_id);
Which two statement are correct?
A.
Both the indexes are created; however, only the ORD_COSTOMER index is visible.
B.
The optimizer evaluates index access from both the Indexes before deciding on which index to use for query execution plan.
C.
Only the ORD_CUSTOMER_IX1 index is created.
D.
Only the ORD_CUSTOMER_IX2 index is created.
E.
Both the indexes are updated when a new row is inserted, updated, or deleted In the orders table.

Explanation:
11G has a new feature called Invisible Indexes. An invisible index is invisible to the
optimizer as default. Using this feature we can test a new index without effecting the execution
plans of the existing sql statements or we can test the effect of dropping an index without dropping
it.
Please fix the typo in A. Should be ORD_CUSTOMER_IX2

Identify three benefits of Unified Auditing.
A.
Decreased use of storage to store audit trail rows in the database.
B.
It improves overall auditing performance.
C.
It guarantees zero-loss auditing.
D.
The audit trail cannot be easily modified because it is read-only.
E.
It automatically audits Recovery Manager (RMAN) events.

Explanation:
A: Starting with 12c, Oracle has unified all of the auditing types into one single unit
called Unified auditing. You don’t have to turn on or off all of the different auidting types
individually and as a matter of fact auditing is enabled by default right out of the box. The AUD$
and FGA$ tables have been replaced with one single audit trail table. All of the audit data is now
stored in Secure Files table thus improving the overall management aspects of audit data itself.
B: Further the audit data can also be buffered solving most of the common performance related
problems seen on busy environments.
E: Unified Auditing is able to collect audit data for Fine Grained Audit, RMAN, Data Pump, Label
Security, Database Vault and Real Application Security operations.
Note:
* Benefits of the Unified Audit Trail
The benefits of a unified audit trail are many:
/ (B) Overall auditing performance is greatly improved. The default mode that unified audit works is
Queued Write mode. In this mode, the audit records are batched in SGA queue and is persisted in
a periodic way. Because the audit records are written to SGA queue, there is a significant
performance improvement.
/ The unified auditing functionality is always enabled and does not depend on the initialization
parameters that were used in previous releases
/ (A) The audit records, including records from the SYS audit trail, for all the audited components
of your Oracle Database installation are placed in one location and in one format, rather than your
having to look in different places to find audit trails in varying formats. This consolidated view
enables auditors to co-relate audit information from different components. For example, if an error
occurred during an INSERT statement, standard auditing can indicate the error number and the
SQL that was executed. Oracle Database Vault-specific information can indicate whether this error
happened because of a command rule violation or realm violation. Note that there will be two audit
records with a distinct AUDIT_TYPE. With this unification in place, SYS audit records appear with
AUDIT_TYPE set to Standard Audit.
/ The management and security of the audit trail is also improved by having it in single audit trail.
/ You can create named audit policies that enable you to audit the supported components listed at
the beginning of this section, as well as SYS administrative users. Furthermore, you can build
conditions and exclusions into your policies.
* Oracle Database 12c Unified Auditing enables selective and effective auditing inside the Oracle
database using policies and conditions. The new policy based syntax simplifies management of
auditing within the database and provides the ability to accelerate auditing based on conditions.
* The new architecture unifies the existing audit trails into a single audit trail, enabling simplified
management and increasing the security of audit data generated by the database.

You upgraded from a previous Oracle database version to Oracle Database version to Oracle Database 12c. Your database supports a mixed workload. During the day, lots of insert, update, and delete operations are performed. At night, Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) and batch reporting jobs are run. The ETL jobs perform certain database operations using two or more concurrent sessions.
After the upgrade, you notice that the performance of ETL jobs has degraded. To ascertain the cause of performance degradation, you want to collect basic statistics such as the level of parallelism, total database time, and the number of I/O requests for the ETL jobs.
How do you accomplish this?
A.
Examine the Active Session History (ASH) reports for the time period of the ETL or batch reporting runs.
B.
Enable SQL tracing for the queries in the ETL and batch reporting queries and gather diagnostic data from the trace file.
C.
Enable real-time SQL monitoring for ETL jobs and gather diagnostic data from the V$SQL_MONITOR view.
D.
Enable real-time database operation monitoring using the DBMS_SQL_MONITOR.BEGIN_OPERATION function, and then use the DBMS_SQL_MONITOR.REPORT_SQL_MONITOR function to view the required information.

Explanation:
* Monitoring database operations
Real-Time Database Operations Monitoring enables you to monitor long running
database tasks such as batch jobs, scheduler jobs, and Extraction, Transformation,
and Loading (ETL) jobs as a composite business operation. This feature tracks the
progress of SQL and PL/SQL queries associated with the business operation being
monitored. As a DBA or developer, you can define business operations for
monitoring by explicitly specifying the start and end of the operation or implicitly
with tags that identify the operation.

Examine the following commands for redefining a table with Virtual Private Database (VPD) policies:
Which two statements are true about redefining the table?
A.
All the triggers for the table are disabled without changing any of the column names or column types in the table.
B.
The primary key constraint on the EMPLOYEES table is disabled during redefinition.
C.
VPD policies are copied from the original table to the new table during online redefinition.
D.
You must copy the VPD policies manually from the original table to the new table during online redefinition.

Explanation:
C (not D): CONS_VPD_AUTO
Used to indicate to copy VPD policies automatically
* DBMS_RLS.ADD_POLICY
/ The DBMS_RLS package contains the fine-grained access control administrative interface, which
is used to implement Virtual Private Database (VPD).DBMS_RLS is available with the Enterprise
Edition only.
Note:
* CONS_USE_PK and CONS_USE_ROWID are constants used as input to the “options_flag”
parameter in both the START_REDEF_TABLE Procedure and CAN_REDEF_TABLE Procedure.
CONS_USE_ROWID is used to indicate that the redefinition should be done using rowids while
CONS_USE_PK implies that the redefinition should be done using primary keys or pseudoprimary keys (which are unique keys with all component columns having NOT NULL constraints).
* DBMS_REDEFINITION.START_REDEF_TABLE
To achieve online redefinition, incrementally maintainable local materialized views are used.
These logs keep track of the changes to the master tables and are used by the materialized views
during refresh synchronization.
* START_REDEF_TABLE Procedure
Prior to calling this procedure, you must manually create an empty interim table (in the same
schema as the table to be redefined) with the desired attributes of the post-redefinition table, and
then call this procedure to initiate the redefinition.
AC is correct
All cloned referential constraints involving the interim tables will be created disabled (they will be automatically enabled after the redefinition) and all triggers on interim tables will not fire till the redefinition is completed. After the redefinition is complete, the cloned objects will be renamed to the corresponding pre-redefinition names of the objects (from which they were cloned from).

Which statement is true about Oracle Net Listener?
A.
It acts as the listening endpoint for the Oracle database instance for all local and non-local user connections.
B.
A single listener can service only one database instance and multiple remote client connections.
C.
Service registration with the listener is performed by the process monitor (PMON) process of each database instance.
D.
The listener.ora configuration file must be configured with one or more listening protocol addresses to allow remote users to connect to a database instance.
E.
The listener.ora configuration file must be located in the ORACLE_HOME/network/admin directly.

Explanation:
Supported services, that is, the services to which the listener forwards client
requests, can be configured in the listener.ora file or this information can be dynamically registered
with the listener. This dynamic registration feature is called service registration. The registration is
performed by the PMON process—an instance background process—of each database instance
that has the necessary configuration in the database initialization parameter file. Dynamic service
registration does not require any configuration in the listener.ora file.
Incorrect:
Not B: Service registration reduces the need for the SID_LIST_listener_name parameter setting,
which specifies information about the databases served by the listener, in the listener.ora file.
Note:
* Oracle Net Listener is a separate process that runs on the database server computer. It receives
incoming client connection requests and manages the traffic of these requests to the database
server.
* A remote listener is a listener residing on one computer that redirects connections to a database
instance on another computer. Remote listeners are typically used in an Oracle Real Application
Clusters (Oracle RAC) environment. You can configure registration to remote listeners, such as in
the case of Oracle RAC, for dedicated server or shared server environments.

Answer C is not correct as PMON used to Listener Registration Prior Rel 12c. From 12c LREG process does Listener Registration
ADE
As stated by winner2001 – in 12c LREG is reponsible for dynamic registration.
Therefore D because:
As a minimum the listener.ora file must include a section for one listener that states its name, the protocol and the listening address it will use.
Answer : A
Ref : From 12c onwards service registration with listener is being done by LGRE background process not PMON
https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/REFRN/GUID-86184690-5531-405F-AA05-BB935F57B76D.htm#REFRN104
Option D is correct but not very appropriate, as per below url
https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/NETAG/listenercfg.htm#NETAG292
Overview of Oracle Net Listener
A listener is configured with one or more listening protocol addresses, information about supported services, and parameters that control its runtime behavior. The listener configuration is stored in a configuration file named listener.ora.
Because the configuration parameters have default values, it is possible to start and use a listener with no configuration.
So as per above statement from Oracle doc its not mandatory to configure listener with a protocol. It would pick default configuration

You are administering a database stored in Automatic Storage Management (ASM). You use RMAN to back up the database and the MD_BACKUP command to back up the ASM metadata regularly. You lost an ASM disk group DG1 due to hardware failure.
In which three ways can you re-create the lost disk group and restore the data?
A.
Use the MD_RESTORE command to restore metadata for an existing disk group by passing  the existing disk group name as an input parameter and use RMAN to restore the data.
B.
Use the MKDG command to restore the disk group with the same configuration as the backed up disk group and data on the disk group.
C.
Use the MD_RESTORE command to restore the disk group with the changed disk group specification, failure group specification, name, and other attributes and use RMAN to restore the data.
D.
Use the MKDG command to restore the disk group with the same configuration as the backedup disk group name and same set of disks and failure group configuration, and use RMAN to restore the data.
E.
Use the MD_RESTORE command to restore both the metadata and data for the failed disk group.
F.
Use the MKDG command to add a new disk group DG1 with the same or different specifications for failure group and other attributes and use RMAN to restore the data.

Explanation:
AC (not E): 
The md_restore command allows you to restore a disk group from the metadata created by the
md_backup command.
md_restore can’t restore data, only metadata.

Which three are direct benefits of the multiprocess, multithreaded architecture of Oracle Database 12c when it is enabled?
A.
Reduced logical I/O
B.
Reduced virtual memory utilization
C.
Improved parallel Execution performance
D.
Improved Serial Execution performance
E.
Reduced physical I/O
F.
Reduced CPU utilization


Explanation:
* Multiprocess and Multithreaded Oracle Database Systems
Multiprocess Oracle Database (also called multiuser Oracle Database) uses several processes to
run different parts of the Oracle Database code and additional Oracle processes for the
users—either one process for each connected user or one or more processes shared by multiple
users. Most databases are multiuser because a primary advantage of a database is managing
data needed by multiple users simultaneously.
Each process in a database instance performs a specific job. By dividing the work of the database
and applications into several processes, multiple users and applications can connect to an
instance simultaneously while the system gives good performance.
* In previous releases, Oracle processes did not run as threads on UNIX and Linux systems.
Starting in Oracle Database 12c, the multithreaded Oracle Database model enables Oracle
processes to execute as operating system threads in separate address spaces.

In order to exploit some new storage tiers that have been provisioned by a storage administrator, the partitions of a large heap table must be moved to other tablespaces in your Oracle 12c database? Both local and global partitioned B-tree Indexes are defined on the table.
A high volume of transactions access the table during the day and a medium volume of transactions access it at night and during weekends.
Minimal disrupt ion to availability is required.
Which three statements are true about this requirement?
A.
The partitions can be moved online to new tablespaces.
B.
Global indexes must be rebuilt manually after moving the partitions.
C.
The partitions can be compressed in the same tablespaces.
D.
The partitions can be compressed in the new tablespaces.
E.
Local indexes must be rebuilt manually after moving the partitions.

Explanation:
A: You can create and rebuild indexes online. Therefore, you can update base
tables at
the same time you are building or rebuilding indexes on that table. You can perform
DML operations while the index build is taking place, but DDL operations are not
allowed. Parallel execution is not supported when creating or rebuilding an index
online.
D: Moving (Rebuilding) Index-Organized Tables
Because index-organized tables are primarily stored in a B-tree index, you can
encounter fragmentation as a consequence of incremental updates. However, you can
use the ALTER TABLE…MOVE statement to rebuild the index and reduce this
fragmentation.
C: If a table can be compressed in the new tablespace, also it can be compressed in the same
tablespace.
Incorrect:
Not B, not E: Local and Global indexes can be automatically rebuild with UPDATE INDEXES when
you move the table.

In your production database, data manipulation language (DML) operations are executed on the SALES table.
You have noticed some dubious values in the SALES table during the last few days. You are able to track users, actions taken, and the time of the action for this particular period but the changes in data are not tracked. You decide to keep track of both the old data and new data in the table long with the user information.What action would you take to achieve this task?
A.
Apply fine-grained auditing.
B.
Implement value-based auditing.
C.
Impose standard database auditing to audit object privileges.
D.
Impose standard database auditing to audit SQL statements.

D
It is B !!!
Standard database auditing does not record old and new values as requested here. With the standard you will only see the statements with the new values (e.g. in case of an update). To get the result you have to implement triggers.

The user SCOTT owns the CUST table that is placed in the SALES tablespace. The user SCOTT opens a session and executes commands as follows:
SQL> INSERT INTO cust VALUES(101, ‘JACK’);
1 row created.
SQL> INSERT INTO cust VALUES(102, ‘SMITH’);
1 row created.
As a DBA, you execute the following command from another session:ALTER TABLESPACE sales READ ONLY;
Which statement is true regarding the effect of this command on the transaction in Scott’s session?
A.
The command fails as a transaction is still pending.
B.
The transaction in Scott’s session is rolled back and the tablespace becomes readonly.
C.
The command waits and the user SCOTT can execute data manipulation language (DML) statements only as part of the current transaction.
D.
The command hangs until all transactions on the objects in the tablespace commit or rollback, and then the tablespace is placed in readonly mode.

C
You can issue the ALTER TABLESPACE…READ ONLY statement while the database is processing transactions. After the statement is issued, the tablespace is put into a transitional read-only state. No transactions are allowed to make further changes (using DML statements) to the tablespace. If a transaction attempts further changes, it is terminated and rolled back. However, transactions that already made changes and that attempt no further changes are allowed to commit or roll back.
It is D !!!
Test it yourself, you will get a ORA-00372 for every further DML that modifys cust table and the transaction is not terminated nor rolled back automatically.
DDL fails with
ORA-00054: resource busy and acquire with NOWAIT specified or timeout expired
D is correct!
The command hangs until a commit or rollback is entered
D – really correct, i tested.
I have a sure that the answer is C!
Any subsequent transaction to the command is not allowed. Even the user who started the previous transactions command.
You cant do anything except commit or rollback then D is the answer right?
